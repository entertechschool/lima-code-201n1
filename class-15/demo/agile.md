# Agile 101

Agile is an iterative approach to delivering a project, which focuses on continuous releases that incorporate customer feedback and improve the product over time. The ability to adjust during each iteration promotes adaptability.

This approach is different from a **waterfall** approach, which follows a set path with limited deviation, hard deadlines, and no room for change.

## Agile Principles

1. Project is segmented into several incremental steps that include regular feedback intervals.
1. Requirements are segmented into smaller pieces, which are then prioritized by importance.
1. Adjusts at regular intervals to ensure a customer's needs are met.

## Agile Advantages

1. Faster feedback cycles.
1. Identifies problems early.
1. Higher potential for customer satisfaction.
1. Time to market is improved.

While discussing the pros and cons of Agile vs Waterfall in lecture, use the whiteboard to depict the different software development life cycles. Use a real world example to illustrate the point.

Simple "Flash Card" application throug the lens of Agile:

- Draw some basic wireframes of what that might look like
  - Box with a question
  - Click
  - Show the answer
- This might be your "MVP"
- What happens after you deliver this to your client?
  - They may want some changes
    - Multiple choice answers
    - Saving progress
    - Game-ify it by letting others steal the answer, etc.
  - Team can evaluate and prioritize and then deliver new features incrementally
